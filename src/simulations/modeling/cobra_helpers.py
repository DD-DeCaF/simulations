def find_reaction(model, id, namespace):
    """
    Search a model for a given reaction, also looking in annotations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: cobra.Model
    id: str
        The identifier of the reaction to find. The comparison is made case
        insensitively.
    namespace: str
        The miriam namespace identifier in which the given metabolite is
        registered. See https://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/collections
        The comparison is made case insensitively.

    Returns
    -------
    cobra.Reaction
        Returns the reaction object.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        If multiple reaction are found for the given search query.
    ReactionNotFound
        If no reactions are found for the given parameters.

def find_metabolite(model, id, namespace, compartment):
    """
    Search a model for a given metabolite, also looking in annotations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: cobra.Model
    id: str
        The identifier of the metabolite to find, e.g. "CHEBI:12965". The
        comparison is made case insensitively. If a match is not found, another
        attempt will be made with the compartment id appended, e.g., looking for
        both "o2" and "o2_e". However, the caller should ideally pass the full
        metabolite identifier.
    namespace: str
        The miriam namespace identifier in which the given metabolite is
        registered. See https://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/collections
        The comparison is made case insensitively.
    compartment: str
        The compartment in which to look for the metabolite.

    Returns
    -------
    cobra.Metabolite
        Returns the metabolite object.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        If multiple metabolites are found for the given search query.
    MetaboliteNotFound
